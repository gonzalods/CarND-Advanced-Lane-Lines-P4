Advanced Lane Lines Finding  Proyect of Nanodegree Self-Driving Car Engineer

# **Proyect: Advanced Lane Lines**

---

## **Overview**

This is the fourth proyect of Nanodegree Self-Driving Car Engineer.

The objective of the project is to detect the lane lines of the road and show them together with the radius of curvature and the position of the vehicle with respect to the center of the lane. 


To do this, a pipeline is built with the steps that must be carried out to complete the project.
